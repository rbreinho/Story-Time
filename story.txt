John knew eating a Bratwurst in a borrowed Porche was a bad idea. 
There he was, on his way from Raesfeld heading to Eltz with his trust hund, Bark Twain.
Along the way, John knew that he had to stop for some Gabaeck. 
John went into the famous local Baeckerei while wearing his white Lederhose. 
There, he bought the tastiest brot he had ever tasted!
After eating the bread, John ordered an Apfelkuchen to-go, and went home and ate it in front of the Klimaanlage. 
Quite quickly, John realized the Klimaanlage was giving him frostbite. 
John lost the key to the schloss and was locked inside as the room continued to freeze.
Thankfully, his hund, Bark Twain, barked so loudly that a woman walking douwn the Hauptstrasse heard and came up to his window.  
She was wearing a dirndel and didn't want to get it dirty so she decided not to break the window and instead continue walking to Ratskeller.
Next came along a large burly man who worked the local Baeckerei. He too heard the barks and came to investigate, but he was so full of Gebaeck, he couldn't fit the door.
This man showed up in his Porsche where he parked right outside the front door.
The large burly man couldn't even fit into his BMW!!!
He decided to break down the door with a wettbewerbsfaehig cry!
After he had done so, offered John some hot apfelkuchen that was sitting in his BMW to warm him up.
After John had warmed up a bit the man wanted to know which was faster, his BMW or John's Porsche, so he challenged John at the biergarten
